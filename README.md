# Auden _Greek Prose Phrasebook_
Ancient Greek-English phrases from Auden _Greek Prose Phrase-Book: Based on Thucydides, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Plato_ (1899). Note that where Auden gave a large number of Greek glosses for an English phrase, some have been removed to make it more suitable for memorization. In addition, footnotes and additional explainations have not been included in this deck. You can find a scan of the full book on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/embed/greekprosephras00audegoog) and a [full transcription by Bedewere](https://archive.org/details/Auden_Gppb).

Nearly every example in _Bradley's Arnold_ (excluding the Introduction) where an English translation is given. The `.tsv` file contains the data set used to generate the Anki flashcards.

The data set contains the Unicode vulgar fractions operator character `U+2044` and Unicode Roman numerals `U+2160`–`U+2188`.

The Anki deck's styling is currently set to use the free font [Libertinus](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus), recommended for its elegant rendering of long vowels even in combinations such as `fi`. Information on changing the deck's styling can be found [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html).
